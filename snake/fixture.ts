// Writes test/shots/snake.json: the store screenshots' fixture.
// The page keeps the phone's memory in storage (the level, the maze, the top
// score, a paused game, rand()'s state), so each palette seeds one: a game
// from game.ts on the firmware's own rand() (seed 1, as at power-on), played
// by a plain steering loop (the shortest way to the food, else any way out)
// until the board is the one the shot wants, then left paused. The shots
// press what a player would: the splash runs out into the menu, Enter on
// Continue draws the paused game still and unlit (the phone waits for a key),
// or the Top score screen, shot once its cup has come to rest. The phone is
// deterministic and none of it is random. `make shots EXT=snake`.
