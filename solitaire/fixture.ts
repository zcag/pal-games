// Writes test/shots/solitaire.json: the store screenshots'
// fixture. The palette is the extension's own view (the surface node and
// the actions ⌘K lists, through the host harness); the page's storage is
// seeded with states from game.ts: a deal from a seeded deck, then that
// deal played forward by a plain greedy player (foundations first, then a
// run that uncovers a card, then the waste, else a draw) to the moment it
// is about to carry a run of three, and on to the win. Nothing random
// runs in the page: a stored state is drawn as it is (no deal animation),
// and a stored win opens the won table without the bouncing cascade.
// `make shots EXT=solitaire`.
