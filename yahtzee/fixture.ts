// from game.ts played by a plain strategy (keep the most common face,
// throw the rest, score the box that adds most) on seeded dice, searched
// seed by seed until the round on the table is the one the shot wants:
// three fours kept after the first throw, a full house after the third,
// a second Yahtzee that has to go in a straight as a Joker, the last box
// filled. The view (the boxes cmd+k lists, the title) is the extension's
// own for that state, through the host harness. No shot throws: a throw's
// tumble is the page's own Math.random, so every die in a picture is one
// the stored state already holds. `make shots EXT=yahtzee`.
