// Writes test/shots/sudoku.json: the store screenshots' fixture.
// The page asks the extension for everything (`pal.send`: the puzzle, the
// stats, today's dailies, the solve), so the fixture runs the extension in
// the host harness over a data file of its own (`PAL_SUDOKU_DIR`, a temp
// directory) and records its replies. The data: today's medium daily (made
// by sudoku.ts from its date, as the extension makes it) half solved by
// sudoku.ts's own deductions with a few pencil marks, and two months of
// solves behind it (dailies on their day at the evening, a streak running
// to yesterday). A second file has the same puzzle one digit from done, for
// the finish. `make shots EXT=sudoku`.
