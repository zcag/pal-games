// the actions ⌘K lists, through the host harness); the page's storage is
// seeded with boards from game.ts: the first open on a seeded field, then
// played forward by a plain solver (a number with its mines flagged opens
// around, a number with as many closed cells as mines left flags them) to
// the moment a shot wants. The mines are laid before the page opens, so
// the page never draws its own; the won and lost shots press the last key
// themselves and wait until the confetti and the blast have settled.
