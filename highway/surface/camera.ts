// The views. Rigid, like Traffic Racer's: the camera never turns with the car
// and never eases after it, so what the car does is what you see it do (its
// heading shows on screen, which is how you judge a turn). It sits a fixed
// fraction of the way between the road's centre line and the car, looks down
// the road, and opens a little with speed (with speed only: tying it to the
// acceleration made every gear change lurch). A hit jolts it from the side it
// came from; after a crash it drifts back and up.
