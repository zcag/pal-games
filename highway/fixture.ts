// Writes test/shots/highway.json: the store screenshots' fixture.
// Each palette seeds the page's storage: a save a few hours in, and a scene
// (game/meta.ts `Scene`) that stages the garage, a run already going (played
// forward by the page's own driver, then shown live) or a run's end. Chance is
// seeded in the page (shots.mjs), so a picture is the same every run.
// `make shots EXT=highway`.
